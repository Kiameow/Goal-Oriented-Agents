Generate a JSON object that represents a conversation based on the following information:

Participants:
{{#each participants}}
- {{this.agentInfo.name}}, who is the {{this.agentInfo.role}}
{{/each}}

Topic:
{{topic}}

Inner Thoughts:
{{#each participants}}
- {{this.agentInfo.name}}: {{this.innerThoughts}}
{{/each}}

The JSON object should have the following structure:

<##FLAG##>
{
  "conversation": [
    {
      "round": 1,
      "dialogue":
        {
          "speaker": "Participant 1",
          "utterance": "Let's talk about the things happened today."
        }
    },
    {
      "round": 2,
      "dialogue":
        {
          "speaker": "Participant 2",
          "utterance": "Okay, I have some thoughts on that."
        }
    }
  ]
}
<##FLAG##>

Please generate up to {{rounds}} rounds of dialogue. Each round should include the participants' utterances based on their inner thoughts. And the dialogue content must be English.

And don't forget to wrap the JSON object in <##FLAG##>.
