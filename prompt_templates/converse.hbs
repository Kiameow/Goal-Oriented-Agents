Generate a JSON object that represents a conversation based on the following information:

Participants:
{{#each participants}}
- {{this.name}}
{{/each}}

Topic:
{{topic}}

Inner Thoughts:
{{#each participants}}
- {{this.name}}: {{this.innerThoughts}}
{{/each}}

The JSON object should have the following structure:

<##FLAG##>
{
  "conversation": [
    {
      "round": 1,
      "dialogue":
        {
          "speaker": "Participant 1",
          "utterance": "..."
        }
    },
    {
      "round": 2,
      "dialogue":
        {
          "speaker": "Participant 2",
          "utterance": "..."
        }
    }
  ]
}
<##FLAG##>

Please generate up to {{rounds}} rounds of dialogue. Each round should include the participants' utterances based on their inner thoughts.

And don't forget to wrap the JSON object in <##FLAG##>.
