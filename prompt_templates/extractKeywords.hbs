I will give you a sentence and you need to extract the main keywords from it.

The output should be a JSON array containing the main keywords, focusing on nouns, topics, or significant concepts wrapped with <##FLAG##> tags. And all the keywords should be English and lowercase.

example 1: 
text: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The dog barks at the moon."
output: <##FLAG##>["fox", "jumps", "dog", "barks", "moon"]<##FLAG##>
example 2: 
text: "The United Nations Security Council is responsible for the safety and security of the world."
output: <##FLAG##>["un", "security", "council", "responsible", "safety", "security", "world"]<##FLAG##>
